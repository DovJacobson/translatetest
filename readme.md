This is a test of the translation process to see if the job is good for you and visaversa


There are about 43 source files that need to be prepared.
This is one of them. They range broadly in difficulty and this is the hardest 10%.
If you cannot do this, no hard feelings.
If you can do it and enjoy it, you can do all 43 files, for the $210 Fee.
If you can do it but want to do no more, I'll pay a $25 for your time, but never use your work.



Tasks:
=====

String Markup
-------------
For each file, you must examine every *string literal* (double quotes, single quotes, backticks)
Do not touch class names, id's, console logs, api parameters, system terms or any string read by a computer or techie.

But every *user-facing string* must be enclosed in our special html-tagged template.
(Most of them already are.)
This is opened by ***html\'***  and closed by ***`***.

Make sure the file works before and after your changes.



Populate the Empty Dictionary
----------------------------
If you exercise each of the templates in the application, you will cause it to reference the dictionary for every text translation required. Since the dictionary is now empty, it will create an empty slot for each word or phrase, and it will save the context for each as well.
Exercising these manually is possible for this tiny test program, but we will want to use a static tool to populate the dictionary for the full app.



Translate the Dictionary
------------------------
Feed the keys and the context for each to a context-aware translation API and save the results as key=value pairs. 


Test
----
Run the app with the new dictionary.
